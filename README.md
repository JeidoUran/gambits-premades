A collection of automated items, spells, feats, and anything else I decide to do! This module primarily uses MidiQOL along with other synergistic modules to achieve these automations, credit to tposney, caewok, zhell, aedif, and saibot for all of their relevant modules.

Currently all automations are included as items in my compendiums, which are lableled as GPS [Automation Item Type]. I have plans to take a module based approach to some of my more advanced automations such as Counterspell and Opportunity Attacks in the future.

I feel like videos are the best way to see these type of automations, so including a partial list of videos below. I'll continue to add more over time.

<details>
<summary><b>Opportunity Attack</b> (click to expand)</summary>
<p>

- This automates opportunity attacks while taking into account opportunity attack specific features of the Sentinel feat, War Caster feat, Polearm Master feat, and Battle Master Fighters Brace feature. This feature will only function while actors are in combat. Note: The Sentinel part of this automation does not stop a token from moving when hit.

<summary><b>Counterspell</b> (click to expand)</summary>
<p>

- This automates counterspell. All situations should work with the exception of counter-counterspell for allies of the initially counterspelled creature. Only the counterspelled creature currently has the ability to counter-counterspell, hoping to add the functionality for allied counter-counterspell in the future.
