- Updates:
  - Updated a TON of reaction items not using activation condition false in activities which was causing the default midi reaction to pop-up as a duplicate. Think I caught everything but let me know if you see a rogue Midi reaction dialog
  - Elemental Affinity 2024: Updated implementation to use the cpr medkit to assign selected damage type instead of a dialog on first use. Added homebrew damage types to medkit selector.
- Bugfixes:
  - Indomitable 2024: Fixed hook never actually getting called, oops
  - Opportunity Attack: Resolved bug where metric wasn't being checked for spells and weapons causing incorrect OA sizing in certain scenarios
  - Dissonant Whispers: Resolved some incorrect and missing variables
  - moveTokenByCardinal: Updated and improved movement functionality
  - moveTokenByOriginPoint: Updated and improved movement functionality, better respects stopping at the origin tokens point
