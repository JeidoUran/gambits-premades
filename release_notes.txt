- V13 and 5e 5.x first release! I would still classify this as a beta, I'm sure there will be some issues so keep that in mind if you want to use it in a live game. If you find a bug, feel free to post it to my gps-bugs channel on my discord
- Updated settings menus to app v2
- Updated module dependencies: Removed Active Auras and added Aura Effects. Converted all existing aura effect automations to the Aura Effects module. Thanks to MrPrimate for maintaining Active Auras for so long, and thanks to Michael for creating a new and more performant module for v13!
- Fully removed GPS Primary GM setting, now relies on MidiQOL's Preferred GM setting instead
- Reworked Region Wrapping to be compatible with V13
- Note: The next release of core Foundry V13 will have a bugfix for some token hitching that is present when moving in and out of a region. This primarily effects Opportunity Attacks, but also other region Execute Script automations so just something to be aware of.
